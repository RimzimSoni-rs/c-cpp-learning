# C/C++ Placement Preparation 

This repository contains my practice and revision programs in C and C++ as part of my placement preparation.
I am revising core programming concepts, problem-solving techniques, and important topics frequently asked in technical interviews.

##  Goals

* Strengthen fundamentals of C and C++
* Practice problem solving and coding logic
* Revise important concepts for technical interviews
* Build consistency in coding

##  Topics Covered

* Basics (syntax, input/output, operators)
* Control statements (loops, conditions)
* Functions and recursion
* Arrays and strings
* Pointers
* Structures
* File handling
* Object-Oriented Programming (C++)
* Data Structures and Algorithms practice

##  How to Run

Compile and run using any C/C++ compiler.

Example:

```bash
gcc program.c -o program
./program
```

or

```bash
g++ program.cpp -o program
./program
```

## 📈 Progress

I regularly update this repository as I continue my revision and practice.
